OSCam build system documentation
================================

 Build variables:
   The build variables are set on the make command line and control the build
   process. Setting the variables lets you enable additional features, request
   extra libraries and more. Currently recognized build variables are:

   CROSS=prefix   - Set tools prefix. This variable is used when OScam is being
                    cross compiled. For example if you want to cross compile
                    for SH4 architecture you can run: 'make CROSS=sh4-linux-'
                    If you don't have the directory where cross compilers are
                    in your PATH you can run:
                    'make CROSS=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/devkit/sh4/bin/sh4-linux-'

   CROSS_DIR=dir  - Set tools directory. This variable is added in front of
                    CROSS variable. CROSS_DIR is useful if you want to use
                    predefined targets that are setting CROSS, but you don't have
                    the cross compilers in your PATH. For example:
                    'make sh4 CROSS_DIR=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/devkit/sh4/bin/'
                    'make dm500 CROSS_DIR=/opt/cross/dm500/cdk/bin/'

   CONF_DIR=/dir  - Set OSCam config directory. For example to change config
                    directory to /etc run: 'make CONF_DIR=/etc'
                    The default config directory is: '/usr/local/etc'

   CC_OPTS=text   - This variable holds compiler optimization parameters.
                    Default CC_OPTS value is:
                    '-O2 -ggdb -pipe -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections '
                    To add text to this variable set EXTRA_CC_OPTS=text.

   CC_WARN=text   - This variable holds compiler warning parameters.
                    Default CC_WARN value is:
                    '-W -Wall -Wshadow -Wredundant-decls -Wstrict-prototypes -Wold-style-definition '
                    To add text to this variable set EXTRA_CC_WARN=text.

   V=1            - Request build process to print verbose messages. By
                    default the only messages that are shown are simple info
                    what is being compiled. To request verbose build run:
                    'make V=1'

 Extra build variables:
   These variables add text to build variables. They are useful if you want
   to add additional options to already set variables without overwriting them
   Currently defined EXTRA_xxx variables are:

   EXTRA_CC_OPTS  - Add text to CC_OPTS.
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_CC_OPTS=-Os'

   EXTRA_CC_WARN  - Add text to CC_WARN.
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_CC_WARN=-Wshadow'

   EXTRA_TARGET   - Add text to TARGET.
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_TARGET=-private'

   EXTRA_CFLAGS   - Add text to CFLAGS (affects compilation).
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DBLAH=1 -I/opt/local"'

   EXTRA_LDFLAGS  - Add text to LDFLAGS (affects linking).
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-Llibdir'

   EXTRA_FLAGS    - Add text to both EXTRA_CFLAGS and EXTRA_LDFLAGS.
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_FLAGS=-DBLAH=1'

   EXTRA_LIBS     - Add text to LIBS (affects linking).
                    Example: 'make EXTRA_LIBS="-L./stapi -loscam_stapi"'

 Use flags:
   Use flags are used to request additional libraries or features to be used
   by OSCam. Currently defined USE_xxx flags are:

   USE_LIBUSB=1    - Request linking with libusb. The variables that control
                     USE_LIBUSB=1 build are:
                         LIBUSB_FLAGS='-DWITH_LIBUSB=1'
                         LIBUSB_CFLAGS='-DWITH_LIBUSB=1'
                         LIBUSB_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_LIBUSB=1'
                         LIBUSB_LIB='-lusb-1.0 -lrt'
                     Using USE_LIBUSB=1 adds to '-libusb' to PLUS_TARGET.
                     To build with static libusb, set the variable LIBUSB_LIB
                     to contain full path of libusb library. For example:
                      make USE_LIBUSB=1 LIBUSB_LIB=/usr/lib/libusb-1.0.a

   USE_PCSC=1      - Request linking with PCSC. The variables that control
                     USE_PCSC=1 build are:
                         PCSC_FLAGS='-DWITH_PCSC=1 -I/usr/include/PCSC'
                         PCSC_CFLAGS='-DWITH_PCSC=1 -I/usr/include/PCSC'
                         PCSC_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_PCSC=1 -I/usr/include/PCSC'
                         PCSC_LIB='-lpcsclite'
                     Using USE_PCSC=1 adds to '-pcsc' to PLUS_TARGET.
                     To build with static PCSC, set the variable PCSC_LIB
                     to contain full path of PCSC library. For example:
                      make USE_PCSC=1 PCSC_LIB=/usr/local/lib/libpcsclite.a

   USE_STAPI=1    - Request linking with STAPI. The variables that control
                     USE_STAPI=1 build are:
                         STAPI_FLAGS='-DWITH_STAPI=1'
                         STAPI_CFLAGS='-DWITH_STAPI=1'
                         STAPI_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_STAPI=1'
                         STAPI_LIB='-L./stapi -loscam_stapi'
                     Using USE_STAPI=1 adds to '-stapi' to PLUS_TARGET.
                     In order for USE_STAPI to work you have to create stapi
                     directory and put liboscam_stapi.a file in it.

   USE_COOLAPI=1  - Request support for Coolstream API (libnxp) aka NeutrinoHD
                    box. The variables that control the build are:
                         COOLAPI_FLAGS='-DWITH_COOLAPI=1'
                         COOLAPI_CFLAGS='-DWITH_COOLAPI=1'
                         COOLAPI_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_COOLAPI=1'
                         COOLAPI_LIB='-lnxp -lrt'
                     Using USE_COOLAPI=1 adds to '-coolapi' to PLUS_TARGET.
                     In order for USE_COOLAPI to work you have to have libnxp.so
                     library in your cross compilation toolchain.

   USE_AZBOX=1    - Request support for AZBOX (openxcas)
                    box. The variables that control the build are:
                         AZBOX_FLAGS='-DWITH_AZBOX=1'
                         AZBOX_CFLAGS='-DWITH_AZBOX=1'
                         AZBOX_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_AZBOX=1'
                         AZBOX_LIB='-Lextapi/openxcas -lOpenXCASAPI'
                     Using USE_AZBOX=1 adds to '-azbox' to PLUS_TARGET.
                     extapi/openxcas/libOpenXCASAPI.a library that is shipped
                     with OSCam is compiled for MIPSEL.

   USE_MCA=1      - Request support for Matrix Cam Air (MCA).
                    The variables that control the build are:
                         MCA_FLAGS='-DWITH_MCA=1'
                         MCA_CFLAGS='-DWITH_MCA=1'
                         MCA_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_MCA=1'
                     Using USE_MCA=1 adds to '-mca' to PLUS_TARGET.

   USE_LIBCRYPTO=1 - Request linking with libcrypto instead of using OSCam
                     internal crypto functions. USE_LIBCRYPTO is automatically
                     enabled if the build is configured with SSL support. The
                     variables that control USE_LIBCRYPTO=1 build are:
                         LIBCRYPTO_FLAGS='-DWITH_LIBCRYPTO=1'
                         LIBCRYPTO_CFLAGS='-DWITH_LIBCRYPTO=1'
                         LIBCRYPTO_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_LIBCRYPTO=1'
                         LIBCRYPTO_LIB='-lcrypto'

   USE_SSL=1       - Request linking with libssl. USE_SSL is automatically
                     enabled if the build is configured with SSL support. The
                     variables that control USE_SSL=1 build are:
                         SSL_FLAGS='-DWITH_SSL=1'
                         SSL_CFLAGS='-DWITH_SSL=1'
                         SSL_LDFLAGS='-DWITH_SSL=1'
                         SSL_LIB='-lssl'
                     Using USE_SSL=1 adds to '-ssl' to PLUS_TARGET.

 Automatically intialized variables:

   TARGET=text     - This variable is auto detected by using the compiler's
                    -dumpmachine output. To see the target on your machine run:
                     'gcc -dumpmachine'

   PLUS_TARGET     - This variable is added to TARGET and it is set depending
                     on the chosen USE_xxx flags. To disable adding
                     PLUS_TARGET to TARGET, set NO_PLUS_TARGET=1

   BINDIR          - The directory where final oscam binary would be put. The
                     default is: Distribution

   OSCAM_BIN=text  - This variable controls how the oscam binary will be named.
                     Default OSCAM_BIN value is:
                      'BINDIR/oscam-VERSVN_REV-TARGET'
                     Once the variables (BINDIR, VER, SVN_REV and TARGET) are
                     replaced, the resulting filename can look like this:
                      'Distribution/oscam-1.20-unstable_svn7404-i486-slackware-linux-static'
                     For example you can run: 'make OSCAM_BIN=my-oscam'

 Binaries compiled and run during the OSCam build:

   OSCam builds webif/pages_gen binary that is run by the build system to
   generate file that holds web pages. To build this binary two variables
   are used:

   HOSTCC=gcc     - The compiler used for building binaries that are run on
                    the build machine (the host). Default: gcc
                    To use clang for example run: make CC=clang HOSTCC=clang

   HOSTCFLAGS=xxx - The CFLAGS passed to HOSTCC. See webif/Makefile for the
                    default host cflags.

 Config targets:
   make config        - Start configuration utility.
   make allyesconfig  - Enable all configuration options.
   make allnoconfig   - Disable all configuration options.
   make defconfig     - Restore default configuration options.

 Cleaning targets:
   make clean     - Remove 'build' directory which contains compiled
                    object files.
   make distclean - Executes clean target and also removes binary files
                    located in 'Distribution' directory.

 Build system files:
   config.sh      - OSCam configuration. Run 'config.sh --help' to see
                    available parameters or 'make config' to start GUI
                    configuratior.
   Makefile       - Main build system file.
   Makefile.extra - Contains predefined targets. You can use this file
                    as example on how to use the build system.
   Makefile.local - This file is included in Makefile and allows creation
                    of local build system targets. See Makefile.extra for
                    examples.

 Here are some of the interesting predefined targets in Makefile.extra.
 To use them run 'make target ...' where ... can be any extra flag. For
 example if you want to compile OSCam for Dreambox (DM500) but do not
 have the compilers in the path, you can run:
    make dm500 CROSS_DIR=/opt/cross/dm500/cdk/bin/

 Predefined targets in Makefile.extra:

    make libusb        - Builds OSCam with libusb support
    make pcsc          - Builds OSCam with PCSC support
