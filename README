Version history
===============

OSCam history is accessible through Trac timeline at:

Repositories
============

SVN repository:
   svn checkout http://www.streamboard.tv/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-svn


Building OSCam from source
==========================

 - Get the lastest sources from SVN
    svn checkout http://www.streamboard.tv/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-trunk

 - Go to oscam-trunk directory.

 - Run `make config` to choose the features you want.

 - Run `make` to compile OSCam.

For more information and examples on using the build system, please
see README.build and README.config files.


Building OScam for different CPUs (cross-compilation)
=====================================================

First you need to install the target CPU toolchain. Already built toolchains
for various architectures can be downloaded from:

    http://www.streamboard.tv/oscam/wiki/crosscompiling/

In order to cross compile OSCam you need to set CROSS variable when
running make. For example to compile for SH4 architecture you need
to run: `make CROSS=sh4-linux-` or if your cross compilers are not
in your PATH - `make CROSS=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/devkit/sh4/bin/sh4-linux-`.


Dependencies
============

OSCam by default do not depend on external libraries except when compilation
with SSL is requested. In that case openssl (libcrypto) library must be
installed.

OSCam supports building with the following external dependencies:
  - libcrypto (libssl) - 'make USE_LIBCRYPTO=1'
  - libusb             - 'make USE_LIBUSB=1'
  - PCSC               - 'make USE_PCSC=1'
  - SH4 STAPI support  - 'make USE_STAPI=1'
  - Coolapi support    - 'make USE_COOLAPI=1'
  - AZBOX support      - 'make USE_AZBOX=1'

For STAPI support you need to download liboscam_stapi.a library and place
it in stapi directory under oscam/ root dir. liboscam_stapi.a can be downloaded
from: http://www.streamboard.tv/wbb2/thread.php?threadid=28854

For more information and examples on using the build system, run `make help`.
