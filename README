OSCam-emu: Open Source Conditional Access Module Emulator
=========================================================

OSCam-emu is an Oscam addon module to include emulator support and other functionality that collides with the goal of the original oscam developers.

This patch creates a virtual card reader which is configured automatically.
You may save the default reader configuration with the webif and then modify it to your own liking.

Key file ("SoftCam.Key"):
OSCam-emu does not require, but will make use of "SoftCam.Key" if available.
"SoftCam.Key" is searched in the oscam config folder (where oscam.conf is located) and also in "/var/keys".

You may use OSEmu instead and add it as a reader to your plain oscam server.
OSEmu can be found at https://github.com/oscam-emu/OSEmu

Supported systems
=================

Currently only the following crypto systems are available:
 - Cryptoworks
 - SoftNDS
 - Viaccess 1/2/3
 - Nagra 2
 - Irdeto 2
 - Biss (Mode 1) [Note: only 1 key possible for a sid/pid combination, use the oscam constcw reader if you need more]
 - PowerVU (via Stream Relay)
 - Drecrypt2
 - Tandberg

All of these are basically working, but far from complete so anyone filling in blanks is welcome...


TODO
====

Work has to be done on the following items:
 - Add other encryption systems


Version history
===============

OSCam-emu history is accessible through GitHub commits at:
   https://github.com/oscam-emu/oscam-emu


Building OSCam-emu from source
==============================

 - Get the lastest oscam sources from SVN:
    svn checkout http://www.streamboard.tv/svn/oscam/trunk oscam-svn

 - Save the oscam-emu.patch file:
    wget https://github.com/oscam-emu/oscam-emu/raw/master/oscam-emu.patch

 - Go to oscam-svn directory:
    cd oscam-svn

 - Patch the source with the EMU patch:
    patch -p0 < ../oscam-emu.patch
    
 - OR: Instead of 'patch', you may also use 'svn patch':
    svn patch ../oscam-emu.patch
    
 - Put a SoftCam.Key file into the oscam-svn directory (for example from skystar.org)
   Note: This does not apply for Mac OSX and Android, SoftCam.Key cannot be integrated on these systems at the moment.
  
 - Run `./config.sh -g` to choose the features you want.

 - Run `make` to compile OSCam.


OSCam dvbapi config
===================

If dvbapi is activated, the "delayer" option is forced to have a value of at least 60.
This is to avoid freezes/crashes because of too fast ecm responses.

BISS/ConstCW config
===================

Syntax for keys in SoftCam.Key: (key number can be '00' or '01')
F <service id><ecm pid> <key number> <key>

Example:

	service id: 2222
	ecm pid: 1111
	key: 0102030405060708

	F 22221111 00 0102030405060708
	
Important:
	The correct ecm pid is only available when using oscam dvbapi.
	For example:
			oscam (dvbapi) <-> OSEmu
			oscam (dvbapi) <-> oscam <-> OSEmu
			
	When using another client like cccam, the ecm pid seen by OSEmu will always be '1FFF'
	For example:
			cccam <-> oscam <-> OSEmu
			cccam <-> OSEmu
	In this case the above example key line needs to be changed to:
	F 22221FFF 00 0102030405060708
	
PowerVU config
==============

Keys in SoftCam.Key:
	
	P <groupid><srvid> <nb> <key>
	Where:	
		groupid = any 4 hex digits of your choice for this group (leading zeros are optional)
		srvid = SID (Service ID) of channel in hex with leading zeros to make 4 hex digits.
		nb = key number (00/01)
		key = ecm key

	Example groupid=0x1, sid=0x1234, keys 00 and 01:
	P 00011234 00 11223344556677
	P 011234 01 22334455667788

	Example groupid=0x2, sid=0x34, keys 00 and 01:
	P 00020034 00 00112233445566
	P 0020034 01 00223344556677

	For channels with the same srvid the correct key will be detected automatically, but each key needs a unique groupid.
	P 009E0234 01 11223344556677
	P 00040234 01 22334455667788
	P 013E0234 01 33445566778899
	
	WARNING - duplicate <groupid><srvid> are not allowed anymore - only the last instance will be used!

	AU keys:
	P <groupid> <UA> <key>
	example:
	P 009E 11223344 11223344556677
	P 009E 44332211 22334455667788
	P 0004 22334455 33445566778899
	P 013E 00112233 00112233445566

	Multiple UA keys are allowed for each group and each UA will update ALL ecm keys in the group.

	NOTE: in order to work, the ecm keys must be "seeded" in the file for each SID you want to update since the UA has no information about sids. 
	So to add a key that is unknown, enter a dummy key to get updated, for example:

	P 00010004 00 00000000000000000
	P 00010004 01 00000000000000000

	Also note: Duplicate powervu keys are no longer allowed (unnecessary since duplicate SIDs should now have a unique group ID.) 
	So, if there are any duplicates, only the last key in the file will be used. 
	This also means that as new keys are found and appended to the file, they will automatically replace earlier keys.


On compatible Dreambox STBs:

	1) Disable the Stream Relay (on by default):
		Webif -> Config -> Stream Relay -> Mode
			0 - disabled
		
		or in oscam.conf:	
			
		[streamrelay]
		stream_relay_enabled = 0
		
	2) Select the correct DVB-Api extended CW API:
		Webif -> Config -> DVB-Api -> API for extended CWs
			1 - OE 2.2
			2 - OE 2.0
			
		or in oscam.conf:
		
		[dvbapi]
		extended_cw_api = 2


On other devices the Stream Relay must be used:

IMPORTANT:
	The stream relay needs a fast CPU. Not every STB is fast enough.
	If you cannot fix stuttering with the following guide, likely your CPU is 
	too slow.

	For best performance, the "Include ECM in http streams" setting must be enabled.
	If your image supports it (openpli, openatv), you can find it here:
	OpenWebif -> Settings -> Customize
	
	If the setting is not available, you may need to adjust the "ECM fix delay"
	setting in oscam webif (Config -> Stream Relay).
	Increase/Lower it until there is no stuttering.

	When using VU+ devices, make sure to use the latest drivers (June 2015), if 
	you encounter any problems.

Channel Config:
1. Go to the OpenWebif and click on the "Stream" button for the channel you want to add.
2. Download and save the .m3u file.
3. Open the .m3u file with a text edior and get the stream link. It looks like this:
	http://stb:8001/1:0:19:0123:3EF:1:C00000:0:0:0:
4. Replace the port (8001) with the relay port (default: 17999) and the host name ("stb") with 127.0.0.1
	http://127.0.0.1:17999/1:0:19:0123:3EF:1:C00000:0:0:0:
5. Add the new stream link to your channel list (for example with DreamBoxEdit)

IMPORTANT:
	Do NOT use the correct Transponder ID/Network ID/Namespace for the stream link.
	Use Transponder ID: "11", Network ID: "22" and Namespace: "33".
	Set Service Type to "1", and enter the correct Service ID for the channel.

Note: 
	When using DreamBoxEdit:
	
	A. Go to the list in the middle "Bouquet details".
	B. Right click on a channel, select "IPTV and other streaming services", select "Add".
	C. Select "DVB/TS".
	D. Chosse a name and use the new stream link as URL.
	E. Use the "Service ID" of the original channel. You can find it in the left list ("Services")
	

Drecrypt config:
=================

Keys from ee.bin files:

Put "ee36.bin" and "ee56.bin" into the config folder (where SoftCam.Key is).
Or: set a custom path for these files with the "extee36" and "extee56" reader settings.

Keys in SoftCam.Key:

Overcrypt keys (16 keys):
D 0 <number> <key>
example:
D 0 0 1122334455667788
...
D 0 F 1122334455667788

AU keys:
D <caid><provider> MK<key type><key index> <key>
example:
D 4AE1FF MKAA01 112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF0011223344556677889900AABBCCDDEEFF
